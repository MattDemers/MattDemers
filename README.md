Hi, I'm Matt Demers!

I work in esports and gaming as someone who connects communities. I'm passionate about gaming, the culture of the Internet, how communities form around those cultures, and how they manage to stay authentic. 

I've been involved with esports and Twitch culture since 2011; it's been a long ride of working at multiple publications, teams and companies. Thanks for checking my little bio out.
